        <h2 id="july4">July 4th</h2>
        <p>Date: July 4th<br><h3>Why do we celebrate July 4th?</h3>On July 4th 1776, the Continental Congress formally adopted the Declaration of Independence</p>

        <h2 id="laborday">Labor Day</h2>
        <p>Labor day is the first Monday in September and it honors the working people of America. In order to avoid that very thing, rather than come up with something, here is a poem.<h4>Find Work By: Rhina Espaillat</h4><img src="labor.jpg" alt="Labor Day" class="yesbird">My mother’s mother, widowed very young<br>
of her first love, and of that love’s first fruit,<br>
moved through her father’s farm, her country tongue<br>
and country heart anaesthetized and mute<br>
with labor. So her kind was taught to do—<br>
“Find work,” she would reply to every grief—<br>
tolled heavy with her passionate belief.<br>
and her one dictum, whether false or true,<br>
Widowed again, with children, in her prime,<br>
she spoke so little it was hard to bear<br>
so much composure, such a truce with time<br>
spent in the lifelong practice of despair.<br>
But I recall her floors, scrubbed white as bone,<br>
her dishes, and how painfully they shone.</p>
        <h2 id="memorialday">Memorial Day</h2><p><img src="memorial.jpg" alt="Memorial Day" class="yesbird">Memorial day is observed on the last Monday of May and it serves to mourn the U.S. military personnel who have died while serving in the United States armed forces.</p>
