   <h1>Welcome to the state government website review!</h1>

   <p class="subheading">Here we will be analyzing the state website of Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, and Nebraska. Included below are a couple of metrics for each site, along with a general review, finished off with an overall ranking.</p>
   <!--review begin-->
   <h2><a href="https://alaska.gov/">Alaska</a></h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Load time: quick (~1 second)</li>
    <li>Logo: 6.5/10</li>
    <li>Design: 8/10</li>
   </ul>
   <p>'Hello, how are you?' is translated from a different language in a way that is pleasant to see. The website's margin makes the website nice to read. There are helpful drop down menus and plenty of content without being overwhelming.</p>
   <h2><a href="https://delaware.gov/">Delaware</a></h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Load time: Slow (3-5 seconds)</li>
    <li>Logo:6/10</li>
    <li>Design: 2/10</li>
   </ul>
   <p></p>
   <h2><a href="https://www.myflorida.com/">Florida</a></h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Load time: quick (~1 second)</li>
    <li>Logo: 3/10</li>
    <li>Design: 3/10</li>
   </ul>
   <p>I like that there is a search bar but there is no drop down when you click on it. This leaves me with little idea of what I should be searching. The content of the website is largely unknown without having explored all of the tabs (which there are not many). This website is very limited with few features. Aesthetically, it looks ok but it has little functionality.</p>
   <h2><a href="https://www.illinois.gov/">Illinois</a></h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Load time: fastest (>1 second)</li>
    <li>Logo: 2/10</li>
    <li>Design: 4/10</li>
   </ul>
   <p>A virtual assistant popped up right away which is a negative because those are never helpful. There are is some well designed helpful content, but it is a bit too busy. It could benefit from a larger margin on the main content section.</p>
   <h2><a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/">Nebraska</a></h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Load time: quick (~1 second)</li>
    <li>Logo: 8/10</li>
    <li>Design: 7.5/10</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Simple, yet helpful design. Announces the important information without overwhelming the user. There is nothing that jumps out as great about this website. It does it's job, and does it pretty well.</p>
