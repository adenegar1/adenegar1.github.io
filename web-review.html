 <p>This website executes a simple concept very well. The premise of this website is to show ridiculous correlations that actually exist. There is some marketing for the book that Tyler Vigen wrote but it is not intrusive and is on topic with the content. The graphs are laid out in a way that is very easy to understand. Each graph can be downloaded in a number of different ways, and scrolling the mouse across the graphs gives more information in a good way. The biggest drawback for this website is that it has not been updated since 2009. The code is easy to navigate. It uses a table for organization. The layout works well for this website's content. It is expressing one idea and doesn't have a lot to show so only one main page is necessary. If they were to expand, they could increase the menu bar and add more content. The color scheme of the website stays consistent with black red and white being the only colors used. A redesign with new colors could improve the website as it has not had an update in a while, but the current color scheme does the job. When scrolling the mouse over a graph the info box that pops up looks very professional and the little amount of movement that the box does adds a lot to the user experience.</p>

 <p>Strava is a social media website for running, cycling, swimming, or other trackable workouts. While most usage of Strava is probably on people's phones, the website adaptation is done well with added features. The home page has a feed of activities of people that I follow and has my own activities on the right. There is also a third column on the right side of the screen that has challenges and friend recommendations. Overall, the screen is a bit busy and the right side seems mostly unnecessary. The code is hard to navigate as it is mostly all script without much labeling. The 3 column layout makes sense although the content on the right or left side could benefit from simplification or removal. The site is easy to navigate with a relevant navigation bar. Strava has a very nice color scheme. The primary orange color combined with soft secondary colors makes for a pleasing aesthetic. Clicking on an activity gives in depth information about the run including mile splits, elevation gain and changes in pace at different points on the run. </p>
 <a href="https://samsung.com">Samsung.com</a>
 <img src="samsung.jpg" alt="Samsung Logo">
 <p>There is so much stuff on my screen. Samsung.com bombards the user with popups as soon as they open up the site. The screen is extremely crowded including an assistant popup. The assistant pop up is better than chatbots because this would lead to me actually talking to a real person, but ideally I would like to navigate the site in peace. The #dowhatyoucant section looks slick. The code is hard to understand including unbroken sections of pseudocode that goes on for at least twenty lines. Again, so much of the code is written in script which makes it hard to understand. The layout is seemingly random which makes for a confusing user experience. Random promotions are all over the place and it's hard to pin down the meaning of any one section. The navigation bar has a surprisingly helpful dropdown menu although some of the links have confusing titles like "bespoke". The color scheme is all over the place. Samsung has a wide variety of products so it only vaguely has a color scheme that makes sense for a tech site. The new take on the dropdown menu is perhaps the most impressive thing about this website. </p>
